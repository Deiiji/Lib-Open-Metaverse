[Extensions]

; Handles sending and receiving packets in the LLUDP format
UDPManager

; LLUDP connection management. Allows agents to connect and disconnect from a
; simulator, as well as keeping the UDP connection alive.
ConnectionManagement

; Main scene graph engine. All spatial events are processed through here.
SceneManager

; Creates an account for anyone who logs in. The account will be registered 
; with the account provider so persistence between sessions is possible, but
; no form of authentication or authorization is done
AuthFreeForAll

; A permissions module that grants full access for everything. Only use this if
; all of the system users are fully trusted
PermissionsFreeForAll

; Implements the login server for Linden-based clients directly into Simian
LindenLogin

;
; ---Local Simulator Extensions---
;
; The following extensions may use persistence, but do not communicate with a
; remote server or other simulators. These extensions are only useful for a
; single simulator running in standalone mode, and will have unexpected results
; if the simulator is part of a larger grid.

; A local account store
AccountManager

; A local asset store using the filesystem to store assets
AssetManager

; A local inventory store
InventoryManager

; A local grid service provider
GridLocal

; A simulator-local messaging layer for instant messages and script e-mails
MessagingLocal

;
; ---End Local Simulator Extensions---
;

; A task inventory store. Handles inventory for objects in a simulator
TaskInventoryManager

; Manages creation and deletion of capabilities (see 
; http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Capabilities for more information).
CapsManager

; Various avatar-related functions including appearance, animations and sounds
AvatarManager

; Other asset downloads
TransferManager

; Converts prims into 3D geometry data. This is only used if a physics engine
; is present that makes use of prim mesh data.
RenderingPluginMesher

; A simple physics engine with good (but slow) implementations of the
; interfaces.
PhysicsSimple

; Physics engine provided by the Open Dynamics Engine library. Work in progress,
; not functional yet.
;PhysicsODE

; Object creation, editing, deleting, etc. Processes packets and passes events
; to the scene provider.
ObjectManager

; Parcel management
ParcelManager

; An scripting engine implementation adapted from OpenSim
XScriptEngine

; Allows LSL functions to be called through chat
ScriptConsole

; Texture downloads
ImageDelivery

; A simple physics engine for avatar movement. Supports walking, flying, and
; swimming as well as avatar-avatar collisions. Does not support avatar-prim
; or prim-prim collisions.
Movement

; Periscope allows you to proxy a foreign grid simulator into the local Simian
; using a libOpenMetaverse bot. The first person to login to Simian will become 
; the master agent, who's movement is tethered to the bot's movement. Any other 
; agents that login can move around freely, but will only see what the master 
; agent is seeing through the periscope. If you enable this extension, disable 
; ImageDelivery and Movement as Periscope has its own implementations of those 
; extensions
